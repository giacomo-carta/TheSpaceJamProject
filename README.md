# The Space Jam Project

Welcome to The Space Jam Project, where we're on a mission to save Earth from an invasion by superhuman aliens using the power of basketball!

## Introduction

In this fantastic scenario, Earth is under threat from a new species of superhuman aliens, and our only chance of survival is to defeat their basketball team in a crucial match. To achieve this, we need to assemble the best basketball team possible.

## Objectives

Our goal is straightforward: draft the best basketball team to save humanity. To do this, we'll use data from the NBA API, using Python and advanced statistical analysis to find the best players. Our drafting process focuses on five main areas:

1. **Wins**: We'll prioritise players who help their team win games by looking at a mix of wins, win percentage, and usage percentage, showing how much they contribute to their team's success.

2. **Offensive Skills**: We'll assess players' ability to score and create opportunities for their teammates, considering factors like shooting accuracy, assists, and offensive rating. We'll also factor in effective field goal percentage and penalise turnovers to ensure a well-rounded offensive strategy.

3. **Defensive Skills**: Defence wins games, so we'll analyse players' ability to steal the ball, block shots, and grab rebounds. We'll also look at their hustle on the court to see how hard they work defensively.

4. **Player Efficiency**: We'll measure players' overall impact on the game using metrics like Box Plus Minus (BPM) and Player Efficiency Rating (PER), giving us insight into how effective they are on both ends of the court.

5. **True Shooting Percentage and Clutch Performance**: We'll consider players' true shooting percentage, which takes into account their accuracy from all types of shots, and their ability to perform in clutch situations when the game is on the line.

With these factors in mind, we'll draft a starting lineup and bench players based on their positions and performance metrics. Additionally, we'll select two wildcard players—one focused on offensive prowess and the other on defensive skills and physical attributes—to add versatility and resilience to our team.

Join us in The Space Jam Project as we build the ultimate basketball team to defend Earth and ensure the future of humanity through the game we love!
